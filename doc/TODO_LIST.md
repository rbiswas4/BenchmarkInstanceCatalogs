# Stuff to add
- Add the parallel code
- Add a chunksize parameter
- ipython notebook demonstrating:
   - graphs of the general scaling with boundlen, number of objects
   - variation of these when querying within a tile and outside 
   - cuts on magnitude and redshift
   - Fixed focal plane (different chunk-size, different numbers of threads)
